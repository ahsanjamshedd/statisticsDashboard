# Statistics Dashboard (Bootstrap frontend)

This is a simple Bootstrap-based frontend mockup of the statistics dashboard design you provided. It uses static HTML/CSS/JS and can be served locally with `lite-server` or by opening `src/index.html` directly.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run start
```

This will open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` (or similar).

Next steps

- If you want a full Angular project, I can convert this into an Angular CLI app and create components/services.
- Tell me which parts should be dynamic (APIs, charts), and I’ll wire them up.
